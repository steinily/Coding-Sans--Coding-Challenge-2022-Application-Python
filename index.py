                      Challenge  1
    What was last week's sales in terms of money?

    With the Tax Authority already breathing down Stevie's neck,
    he quickly needs to report his last week of sales. Based on the data you received,
    calculate how much money he generated, if he only needs to report his total sales.

    Your function should take the whole data-set, and return a number,
    calculated based on his last week's sales, and the price he sells the sweets for.

    Create a menu for people with food allergies.

    Currently, Stevie keeps all information about gluten 
    or lactose free options in his head,and his memory isnt getting better.
    To avoid him having a local hospital on speed-dial,
    create a list of gluten and lactose-free items!
    It should have three sections, gluten-free only ,
     lactose-free only , and both gluten and lactose-free.

    Your function should take the whole data-set,
    and return an object, with the three options containing an array 
    of objects with the name,and price of each item.

    What was last week's profit?

    Now that the Tax Guys are off his back, and people with food allergies are safe,
    Stevie wants to know how much money he actually made last week. 
    Based on the quantity of the items sold,with the ingredients taken into account,
    calculate the difference between the sum of sale prices 
    and the wholesale price of the ingredients used.

    Your function should take the whole data-set, and return a number,
    the difference between the amount of money selling sweets generated,
    and the cost of producing them, 
    calculated based on the wholesale price of the ingredients used.

    The freedom of choice

    The best-selling items are already available,
    but Stevie wants to know what sweets he could make without 
    purchasing additional ingredients, only working from his existing inventory.

    At this point, Stevie confesses with tears in his eyes that he somehow managed to go 
    through primary school without actually
    learning metric unit conversions. He only knows milliliters and grams, so the recipes 
    in his cookbook are in these units.
    However, his inventory software, and the wholesaler 
    both report in kilograms and liters.

    This hasn't been much of a problem as long as he was conducting heart surgeries,
     apart from getting weird looks from his butcher
    when asking for 1523 grams of chicken breast. But he can't run a bakery like this,
     so he needs your help.

    Give Stevie the amount of sweets he could produce,if he used his 
    entire inventory for one recipe.
    Do this for each recipe he can make based on his current inventory and list it in
     alphabetic order based on the recipe's name.
    Your function should take the whole data-set, and return a list matching the
     structure of the example below.

          Challenge  5
      The wedding of the Godfather's daughter

    Stevie made some bad choices in the past,
    and getting involved with shady people was definitely one of them.
    A few days ago, two guys came into the shop,
    and reminded him that Guido the Merciful is having a wedding for his only daughter.
    For the wedding, they requested the following items to be made,
     in a manner Stevie just could not refuse:

    Francia krémes : 300
    Rákóczi túrós : 200
    Képviselőfánk : 300
    Isler : 100
    Tiramisu: 150

    Calculate how much money this sets poor Stevie back,
    who regrets asking for money all those years ago from 
    the mafia for his already bankrupt Ostrich Farm.
    Stevie wants to keep his cakery running, so he doesnt want to touch his inventory.

    For the amount, calculate the ingredients price on wholesale.
    Your function should take the whole data-set (the order) 
    and return a number (the amount of his losses in money).
    For some help, you can use the array below for the order:

    [
        [
            {
            "name": "Francia krémes",
            "amount": 300
            },
            {
            "name": "Rákóczi túrós",
            "amount": 200
            },
            {
            "name": "Képviselőfánk",
            "amount": 300
            },
            {
            "name": "Isler",
            "amount": 100
            },
            {
            "name": "Tiramisu",
            "amount": 150
            }
        ]

          Challenge  6
        Next two week's sales

    Consistency and plannability are key!

    Based on this mantra, Stevie wants to know the ingredients he should order 
    to last him two weeks combined with his inventory.
    He already knows last week's sales, and he assumes 
    the next two weeks will be the same. 
    To be on the safe side, he'd like to have a 10% surplus of everything on top of the 
    amount which would last two weeks.

    Calculate the amount of ingredients based on past sales for the next two weeks,
    and add 10% on top of it. 
    Your function should take the whole data-set, and return a shopping list for Stevie 
    to take to his wholesaler, 
    based on the example below. Remember, the wholesaler needs the 
    amounts in kilograms and liters.
